# tcVNS_Response_Modeling
This repository contains the necessary code to replicate the methods described in "Dynamic Modeling of Digital Cardiovascular Biomarker Responses to Transcutaneous Cervical Vagus Nerve Stimulation" by Gazi et al. (forthcoming).

This code requires that the MATLAB Signal Processing and System Identification Toolboxes be installed.

Running the 'main' script will run all necessary constituent scripts to reproduce the results for this example subject.

The results will be stored in appropriate files within the 'Results' directory.
